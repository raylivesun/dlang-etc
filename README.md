        <h2>Background</h2>
        <hr>
<p>Use of digital health devices has grown; in 2016, only 12% of Americans were estimated to
regularly use a wearable digital health device, but by 2020, the estimation jumped to 21% [1].
Digital Health Technologies (DHTs), including wearable sensors like smart watches, have the
potential to inform us about our health. But there are gaps in who has access to data and devices,
who is performing the research, and therefore who the new technologies are poised to help.
Reviews of the current landscape of DHT research studies in the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI)’s Clinical Trials database (clinicaltrials.gov), and of studies
published by the top-20 funded private sector DHT companies, highlight several patterns and
limitations:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p><b>Small sample size:</b> Aside from a few large studies, most of the published clinical trials
        utilizing DHT have been relatively small, and are largely under-powered. “Nearly half the
        studies - 829, or 46.5% - had less than 100 enrollees. Only 8% had more than 1,000 [2].”</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Narrow Health Focus:</b>The majority of published DHT studies focus on cardiometabolic
        health and mental health/wellness, while relatively little published research examines critical
        healthcare burden diseases like stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and
        diabetes [2].</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Narrow Population Focus:</b> Of studies published by the top 20 funded DHT private-sector
        companies, the majority (72%) include only healthy volunteers, rather than high-risk
        populations with comorbid conditions [3]. The breadth and diversity of the study
        population(s), including socioeconomic, healthcare status, and racial diversity, may be the
        most critical component of building AI-based DHT algorithms. This diversity is lacking in
        current published research, likely leading to biased results [4]. The “bring your own device”
        model has been used by many research studies, but this design may result in biased selection
        of participants, and therefore biased results [5].</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Limited Outcome Assessments:</b> Only 15% of published DHT studies measured clinical
        effectiveness, and only in relation to the patient outcomes and did not evaluate healthcare cost
        or access to care [6]. As healthcare cost and access are two of the most pressing needs in
        healthcare, it is important to expand research to examine these outcomes.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Insufficient Reporting and Data Publishing:</b> Importantly, not only is reporting in
        clinicaltrials.gov not required for observational DHT trials, there is also no public database for
        DHT data and algorithms. This complicates the ability to understand the full range of DHT
        “real world evidence” (RWE)-based research, and undermines research reproducibility and
        validation. The lack of a consensus DHT database also means that DHT data curation, feature
        (e.g., digital biomarker) discovery, and algorithm development is limited to those who have
        data, which is largely the private sector DHT companies. One attempt to develop standardized
        pipelines and data repositories for digital health data, the Digital Health Data Repository as
        part of the Digital Biomarker Discovery Pipeline [7], developed by co-organizer Jessilyn
        Dunn’s lab, is still not fully funded.
