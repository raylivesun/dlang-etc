Background
Use of digital health devices has grown; in 2016, only 12% of Americans were estimated to
regularly use a wearable digital health device, but by 2020, the estimation jumped to 21% [1].
Digital Health Technologies (DHTs), including wearable sensors like smart watches, have the
potential to inform us about our health. But there are gaps in who has access to data and devices,
who is performing the research, and therefore who the new technologies are poised to help.
Reviews of the current landscape of DHT research studies in the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI)’s Clinical Trials database (clinicaltrials.gov), and of studies
published by the top-20 funded private sector DHT companies, highlight several patterns and
limitations:*/

Narrow Population Focus: Of studies published by the top 20 funded DHT private-sector
companies, the majority (72%) include only healthy volunteers, rather than high-risk
populations with comorbid conditions [3]. The breadth and diversity of the study
population(s), including socioeconomic, healthcare status, and racial diversity, may be the
most critical component of building AI-based DHT algorithms. This diversity is lacking in
current published research, likely leading to biased results [4]. The “bring your own device”
model has been used by many research studies, but this design may result in biased selection
of participants, and therefore biased results [5].*/
