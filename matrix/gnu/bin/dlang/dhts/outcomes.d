Limited Outcome Assessments: Only 15% of published DHT studies measured clinical
effectiveness, and only in relation to the patient outcomes and did not evaluate healthcare cost
or access to care [6]. As healthcare cost and access are two of the most pressing needs in
healthcare, it is important to expand research to examine these outcomes.*/
